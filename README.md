# CH3030_AMT
Solutions for the tutorials in the course Applied Mass Transfer. Contents of the tutorials (most of graphs and calculations implemented in MATLAB):
1. Number of plates for absorption (eqbm curve using spline interpolation of data/Raoult's law), minimum flow rate; (stepping b/w operating line
2. Height of Packing (MATLAB implementation), Kremser's method
3. Stripping (theoritical plates), Overall Mass Transfer Coefficient in terms of gas and liquid phase coefficients
4. McCabe-Thiele method
5. Ponchon Savarit Method
6. McCabe-Thiele method again (stepping done in MATLAB)
7. Adsorption isotherms (curve fitting comparison: Langmuir vs Freundlich), Solute Adsorption (kinetics), Packed Bed Adsorption
8. Ternary plot: number of stages, flow rates (Right Triangle and Equilateral triangle)
9. Ternary diagram again (but neater report :P)
10. Batch Drying: Constant rate, Critical & equilibirum moisture content
11. Length of Heat Exchanger
